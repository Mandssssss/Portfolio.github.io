                I’m Armando Bagason Jr, a passionate frontend developer currently studying BSCS and I love creating beautiful and functional web applications, and I’m excited to share a bit about myself with you. <br><br><br>
                My journey in web development began with a fascination for how websites are built and the creativity involved in designing user interfaces. Over time, I’ve developed a small skill set in HTML, CSS. <br><br><br>
                In my spare time, I enjoy exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, and working on personal projects that challenge my skills. I’m also an advocate for clean, maintainable code and believe that good design enhances user experience. <br><br><br>
                If you’d like to know more about my work or collaborate on a project, feel free to get in touch!<br><br><br>
